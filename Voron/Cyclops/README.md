***Note: I would advise sticking with the fixed focal cameras. You will need at least a 78mm long cable. I used a 300mm cable for my 2.4 300^3 which has the Pi mounted at the front of the printer. My current setup is the OV5640 60 degree module replaced with a OV5640 68 degree 78mm camera and a 300mm cable to the Pi.***
