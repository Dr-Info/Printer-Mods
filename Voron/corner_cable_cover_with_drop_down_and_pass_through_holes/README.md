# Top Corner Cable Cover with Drop Down Holes (LED Wires)
Designed to hide cables that are running around the top corners of 2.4R2 extrusions behind the Z idlers. There are added drop down holes for running down the extrustions and inline holes with cutouts to keep the wire management as clean as possible.

Holes are big enough to allow 2 pin microfit connectors pass through. Works perfectly with LDO LED PCB breakout board.

**CAUTION**
Check your max Z travel as there will be some loss.
